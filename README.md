# Perl plugin for Semantic Merge

This plugin is designed to be used with Plastic SCM's Semantic Merge product.
It allows Semantic Merge to work with Perl code by providing the necessary
parsing support.

Guidance in its writing came from the documentation on the writing of [external parsers](https://users.semanticmerge.com/documentation/external-parsers/external-parsers-guide.shtml).
